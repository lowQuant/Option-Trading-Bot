# Options Trading Bot Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
Work in progress. This project is focused on identifying trading opportunities with a statistical edge.
We are selling volatility after earnings announcements and buying volatility before earnings.
Both strategies can be explained by behavioral finance and are likely anomalies with a chance to persist over time.

### Strategies
- 📉 **Short Put Options**: Post earnings announcements
- 📈 **Long Straddles**: Prior to earnings when IV is low
- 📦 **Box Spreads**: Between earnings seasons

  - Higher values indicate potential candidates for short puts
  - Values above 2x suggest significant overpricing of options
