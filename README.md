# Options Trading Bot Analysis

## üöÄ Project Overview
Work in progress. This project is focused on identifying trading opportunities with a statistical edge.
We are selling volatility after earnings announcements and buying volatility before earnings.
Both strategies can be explained by behavioral finance and are likely anomalies with a chance to persist over time.

### Strategies
- üìâ **Short Put Options**: Post earnings announcements
- üìà **Long Straddles**: Prior to earnings when IV is low
- üì¶ **Box Spreads**: Between earnings seasons
